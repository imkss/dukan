## TypeScript Learnings

- We can use dynamic className by using helper function like cn. 
```layout.tsx``` Line no : 22
```NavItem.tsx``` Line No : 27

- We can pass props as an interface. 
```NavItem.tsx``` Line No : 4

## Xtra Learnings

- Tailwind is a mobile first CSS styling library

- There can be only one TOP LEVEL CHILD in this component in ```app/page.tsx``` for resolving it we use ```<> </>``` also known as EMPTY FRAGMENT

- Next.js by default perform server side rendering. To use client side rendering we have to mention ```"use client"``` on the top which allows us to make use of ```state & hooks, OnClick or any other DOM```
